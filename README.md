#Food Finder App
Overview
For project #2, I created an app that allows an individual to find free food in their office space or school.

After conferences, events, and meetings, there is usually tons of catered food that is left over that usually goes to waste. Food Finder App will allow people to log in and find that food.

#Background
My initial plan was to code the game in a way that was less logical yet worked very well. This would have been a lot less complicated for me. I took the route that was logical/ DRY and a few elements that I want to work, do not work. This is a learning area for me because I will next time do the way that I am 100% confident in and work to clean up code later.

#Moving Forward
I want to make it more specific to a location

#Future Development
The initial vision of the project was to create a fun trivia game to highlight the top attractions for people to do when visiting or planning to relocate to Atlanta. Think, a product for the chamber of commerce to advertise on their website as well as maybe in the airport.

To do this, I want to make the questions and answers pop up in a modal with pictures and links to the attractions. I want to also include links to purchase tickets as well as other important information like hours of operation. I plan to make this site responsive and add a two player element. I also would like to include a "leaderboard" that allows user to input their name and see how they rank against other players.
